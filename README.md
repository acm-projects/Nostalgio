# <h1 align="center">Nostalgio</h1>

<p align="center">
Nostalgio is an app that captures your listening and travel habits to make your travel and music experiences memorable. By linking to your Spotify account, it uses your listening patterns and data on what others have listened to at the same location to predict and recommend music you might enjoy. Nostalgio enhances your daily life and travel experiences by creating a musical map of your journeys, turning ordinary moments into memorable ones with personalized, location-specific music.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)


* User account with user authentication
* Memory saving (Allows users to save a list of songs attributed to a location)
* Memory map visualization (A map that depicts locations traveled and its associated memories & songs over time)
* Spotify integration to create playlists from these memories
* Music suggestion based off of previous travel and listening habits
* Track and display songs listened to by friends on map. (Can comment/react)
  



## Stretch Goals

* Audio recognition: recognizes songs in the area and adds it to your memories for that location.
* Augmented Reality (AR) integration (AR trails that guide users through a city or location with music suggestions popping up at different spots. As users walk along the trail, they can experience the music history associated with each landmark.)

## Tech Stack
* Wireframing: Figma
* IDE: VSC
* Frontend: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [MapBox Gl](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/maps-sdk-for-react-native/)
  * React Native is a cross compatible framework that paired with expo allows you to bring your apps to life while in development phases
  * MapBox is a community-maintained React Native library that provides reusable JavaScript components for integrating Mapbox maps into iOS and Android apps.
* Backend: [AWS Lambda](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda), [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)/[S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) Or [Firebase/Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), [MapBox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/)
  * AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources
  * DynamoDB and S3 continue with the fully AWS approach however, Firebase/Firestore work great as needed
* User Authentication: [Firebase / React Native Authentication](https://rnfirebase.io/auth/usage) or [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs)

## Competition ü´¢
* Spotify - even though they have recommended playlists, they not location based and don't have a feature to save these memories onto a map
* Shazam - Shazam identifies songs based on audio samples and offers a way to discover new music. It also has some location-based features that show popular songs in specific areas. But it 
  does not have the memory map
